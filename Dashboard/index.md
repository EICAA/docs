# Account Settings

The Account Settings button will take you to the “Accounts Page”.

# Logout

The logout button will log you out of the EICAA platform and allows you to sign in again, using the same or a different account.

# Live Self-Assessments

This section of the Dashboard shows you all the Self-Assessments that are currently “live”, meaning that you have created and are open to participation. If you can’t find an assessment here that you are looking for, it may have been automatically archived due to the end date of the assessment being reached.

# Archive Assessment

An assessment is automatically archived if you set an end date for the previously created self-assessment. When you don’t set an end date for the assessment, you can manually archive the assessment. This option is symbolized by the _pause button _on the home screen.

Once you archive an assessment (or it is automatically archived), you find the self-assessment under the _Archived Assessments_ menu point.

# Preview assessment

The “Preview Assessment” button will open a preview version of your assessment in a new browser tab. This allows you to go through and check the settings of the assessment without actually submitting your answers. Answers in the Preview assessment will not show up in your assessment results.

# Copy assessment URL

The „Copy Assessment url“ button will copy the participation link (URL) to your clipboard. The message „URL copied successfully“ will confirm that the URL has successfully been copied. You can either share it directly with your participants or copy it into your browser to open the assessment yourself.

# Assessment Summary

You can review your assessment settings by clicking on the _i button. _The summary provides an overview of the assessment name, maximum participants, the start and end dates, demographic questions, downloading the participant summary, your set languages, and lastly, the assessment link. Moreover, you can directly copy the assessment URL, create a QR code, or preview the created assessment.
