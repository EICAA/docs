Once you have selected the self-assessment(s) by pressing “update dashboard”, you will get an analytical summary that provides some basic information (e.g. number of self-assessment participants) together with key performance indicators of the self-assessment(s) on group level: average score per competence area for the group, along with the top competence strengths and weaknesses of the group.

## Group Score Averages

This section shows a spider chart of the averages of all the competences. The outer of the spider chart means a higher score and the closer to the center means a lower score.

## Proficiency Level Distribution

This section shows a histogram of the distribution of participants across the 5 progression levels (None, Basic, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert). It explains what proportion of the participants falls in each progression level i.e. how many of the participants are at the Basic level, Intermediate level, and so on.

## Data Export

The data query menu on the top left side also allows you to download the raw data of the self-assessment(s). To do so, click on “Export (raw csv)” to get the data and click on “Export (keys)” to get the variable names etc. allowing you to make sense of the raw data. Please note that the raw data is not standardised.  The data export option allows you to prepare further analysis of the self-assessment data that go beyond what is shown in the data dashboard.
