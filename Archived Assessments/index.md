# Archived Assessments

## Navigation

_Archived Assessments_ is the third menu point on the left-side menu. The archive is symbolized by a file box symbol.

Archiving by our means relates to deactivating the self-assessment. Once you archive the assessment, your participants can no longer access the assessment via the link. You can reactivate the assessment at any point by clicking on the _play button_, and then participants will be able to access the self-assessment with the same link as before.

Only archived assessments are able to be displayed at the _Competence Monitor_ or exported to .csv.

## Archiving an Assessment

An assessment is automatically archived if you set an end date for the previously created self-assessment. When you donâ€™t set an end date for the assessment, you can manually archive the assessment. This option is symbolized by the \_pause button \_on the home screen.

Once you archive an assessment (or it is automatically archived), you find the self-assessment under the _Archived Assessments_ menu point.

## De-Archiving an Assessment

An archived assessment is no longer visible to participants, and the link to the assessment is no longer active. You can reactivate an assessment at any time by navigating within your already-archived assessments and reactivating a specific one. For reactivation, you have to click on the _play button_ of the assessment.

The assessment then vanishes from the _archived assessments_ page and moves back to the \_home screen, \_where it is then live again. The URL of the assessment remains the same.

## Preview Assessment

While your assessment is archived, you can still preview your self-assessment. In order to take a look at your created assessment, you can click on the _eye symbol. _

In a new tab, the preview opens up. The preview is symbolized by the red preview box on the top right corner.
